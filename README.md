# dicebag
A collection of useful tools for running or participating in D&D.

The idea behind this is to provide a grab bag of tooling that groups can choose to use as they see fit.

This is also an experiment in writing a web app using WASM and Rust with a GraphQL-powered backend.

## Roadmap
- Character Sheet: In Progress
- Dice Roller: In Progress
- Encounter Builder: Not Started
- Campaign Manager: Not Started

The project is split into two main sections, `ui` and `server`.

### UI
See [the README](./ui/README.md) for more details.
